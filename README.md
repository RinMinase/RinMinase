## Hi there!! Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš§ I'm a full-stack web developer working in many projects using JavaScript / Typescript frameworks (React, Angular and VueJS) and uses either NodeJS (Plain NodeJS, Express, Meteor and Sails) or PHP (Laravel, Lumen, Symfony) as its backend / REST API. I also have a deep knowledge on CSS (or CSS pre-processors) to extremely customize websites.

â™¥ What I really love most, is working with front-end design and UX, making it extremely fast and fluid.

ðŸ”¨ I have also tried working with Java, C, C++, and bit of Python (Flask), Julia and Ruby (RoR). Tools like Docker and creating batch / shell scripts are also on my arsenal to speed up development and setup process. I have rummaged a lot on Webpack to learn on how to improve the build and compile times, and to learn on how it compiles the source code. 

ðŸŽ¨ On my free time I enjoy learning any programming language, concepts, technologies (or anything actually) that piques my interest. I also learn on different ways on how to reorganize code, various design patterns and much, much more.
