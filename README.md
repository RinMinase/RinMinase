### Hi there!! Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš§ I'm a full-stack developer working in projects mainly using JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, VueJS, NextJS) and uses either NodeJS or PHP (Laravel) as its backend / API.

ðŸŽ¨ On my free time I'm learning any programming languages that piques my interest. I also learn on different ways on how to reorganize code, various design patterns and many, many more.
