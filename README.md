## Hi there!! Welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš§ I'm a full-stack web developer working in many projects using JavaScript / Typescript frameworks (React, Angular and VueJS) and uses either NodeJS (Plain NodeJS, Express, Meteor and Sails) or PHP (Laravel, Lumen, Symfony) as its backend / REST API. I also have a deep knowledge on CSS (or CSS pre-processors) to extremely customize websites. I have also worked with ElectronJS to create desktop applications.

â™¥ What I really love most, is working with front-end design and UX, making it extremely fast and fluid for the end-user.

ðŸ”¨ I have also tried working with Java, C, C++, a bit of Julia and Ruby (RoR). Tools like Docker and creating batch / shell scripts are also on my arsenal to speed up development and setup process. I've also had a lot of hands-on experience with both setting up and debugging Linux and Windows servers.

ðŸ”¬ In JavaScript, I have rummaged a lot on their transpilers such as Webpack and Babel, task runners such as Grunt and Gulp to learn on how to improve the build and compile times, and to learn on how it transpiles the source code.

ðŸŒ± As of the moment, I'm currently learning on both Flask (Python) and Swift.

ðŸŽ¨ On my free time I enjoy learning any programming language, concepts, technologies (or anything actually) that piques my interest. I also learn on different ways on how to reorganize code, various design patterns and much, much more.
